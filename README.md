# Dynamic Modeling of Electric Power Equipments via OpenModelica

This repo contains the dynamic modeling and simulation results of three electric devices, as well as a dynamic modeling and simulation regarding electromechanical energy conversion.

The OpenModelica software was employed to dynamically model and simulate:

[1) Electromechanical Fundamentals](dynamic_modeling_fundamentals/)

[2) Transformer](dynamic_modeling_transformer/)

[3) Induction Motor](dynamic_modeling_induction_motor/)

[4) Synchronous Machines](dynamic_modeling_synchronous_machines/)
